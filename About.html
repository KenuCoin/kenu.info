              Kenu is an intergalactic traveler who decided to settle on our Earth, becoming a symbol of a new era. Today, he drives the community and introduces innovations that bridge the virtual and real worlds, changing the way we perceive culture, technology, and ourselves. Kenu opens the door to a future never seen before – resistant to censorship and fueled by creative freedom, he creates a space without limits where anyone can be part of something bigger. His strength grows with the support of the community: the more people unite around Kuku, the greater the influence and new opportunities he brings. Kenu is a symbol of freedom, the voice of the people, and a herald of a future the world has yet to experience
